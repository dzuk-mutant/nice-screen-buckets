# Nice Screen Buckets

A detailed, encapsulated way of tracking and storing browser screen data and comparing that with a series of pre-built buckets to determine the ergonomic and presentation needs of your interfaces.

You can use these buckets in a variety of ways:
- As elm-css Media Queries.
- As normal Elm model data.
- In your own custom ways with the raw bucket data.

Each of the buckets has been researched and designed around different categories of displays that keep recurring throughout different classes of devices. They are fine-tuned as well so you can provide very nice and seamless layouts for your users regardless of what devices they may use.
